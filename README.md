# Django-Phonebook-Project
 In this project I used Django to create a contacts agenda with name, phone, email that is located in an SQL database and can be access by the users logged in

### Funcionalities:
 * Main page :arrow_right: Access to all Contacts information that was created by a registered user. 
   - Each contact has a link that expands the information
   - There is a search field that can find contacts by searching the first name, last name or phone number
 * Sign up page :arrow_right: A user can register and can access the Dashboard to create new contacts for the agenda 
 * Login page :arrow_right: After registration, user can access his dashboard using email and password
 * Dashboard page :arrow_right: Only accessed if the user is logged in, can create new Contacts
 * Admin page :arrow_right: Accessed by superuser to edit, create and delete users or contacts
